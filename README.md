## Cleric Kits

**Dawnbringer of Lathander**
DAWNBRINGER OF LATHANDER: Dawnbringers are the representatives of Lathander, a widely worshiped deity of birth, renewal, health, and the dawn. Dawnbringers are especially vigilant foes of the undead, which they see as a plague upon the living, corrupting the life that is the gift of Lathander. They look to cleanse the world with Lathander's light, eradicating any undead with its purifying rays.

Advantages:
- Turns undead as a cleric four levels higher than their current level.
- Can cast Boon of Lathander as a special ability once per day. The Dawnbringer gains an additional use at levels 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20.
BOON OF LATHANDER: This spell lasts 1 round per level of the caster. It gives the caster a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls, a +1 bonus to all Saving Throws, and 1 extra attack per round. It also protects the caster from level drain.
- Can cast False Dawn as a special ability once per day at 9th level. The Dawnbringer gains an additional use at levels 20 and 30. The ability functions as the cleric spell of the same name.

Restrictions:
- Alignment: Any good, or lawful neutral.
- Multiclass: Fighter/Clerics, and Fighter/Mage/Clerics can all be Dawnbringers.

**Hand of Torm**
HAND OF TORM: Hands seek to emulate their deity Torm, who is known for his steadfast loyalty and dedication to all that is good.  While a great many of his worshipers are Champions (known as Paladins or Holy Champions of Torm), as Torm is the patron of Paladinhood, Hands are no less fierce and loyal to the cause of their god (if slightly less martial).

Advantages:
- Hands are special among clerics in that they gain focus in the protection sphere.
- Hands can cast Command as a spell like ability once per day.  <PRO_HESHE> can use this ability an additional time at levels 5, 10, 15, and 20.  This ability functions like the spell of the same name.
- Hands are able to gain proficiency in any weapon or fighting style.  Additionally, they can gain 2 pips in sword and shield fighting style.
- At 3rd level, a hand can cast detect evil as a spell like ability, once per day.  They gain an additional use of this ability at levels 7, 10, 13, 16 and 19.  This ability functions like the spell of the same name.
- At 4th level, a hand can cast protection from evil as a spell like ability once per day.  They can use this ability an additional time at levels 8, 12, 16 and 20.  This ability functions like the spell of the same name.

Restrictions:
- Alignment: Lawful good, lawful neutral, or neutral good only.
- Multiclass: Fighter/Clerics can be Hands of Torm.

**Luckrider of Tymora**
LUCKRIDER OF TYMORA: Also known as Lady Luck, Tymora is the goddess of good fortune. The sect of her clerics known as Luckriders eat, drink, and sleep luck. Confident to the point of cockiness, they enter battle recklessly, throwing caution to the wind and trusting in fate. Considering how many adventurers perish despite crafting meticulous strategies and plans, this is not a ridiculous position.
 
Advantages:
- Luckriders are innately lucky, receiving the effects of the Luck spell permanently.
- May cast an area-of-effect "Tymora's Luck" spell innately once per day, and once more for each 5 levels of experience gained.

TYMORA'S LUCK:

The allies of this spellcaster gain extraordinary luck for the next 1 turn, receiving a +1 bonus to their saving throws, attack rolls, and minimum damage/healing rolls as well as +5% to all thieving skills. Furthermore, damage dice for all effects outside a weapon's base damage is reduced by 1. Finally, spells that offer saving throws to enemies are more likely to be effective: a spell that usually offers a saving throw with no penalty will instead offer a saving throw with a -2 penalty.

Restrictions:
- Alignment: may not Lawful or Evil.
- Multiclass: Cleric/Thieves can be Luckriders

**Watcher of Helm**
WATCHER OF HELM: Like their deity, Watchers of Helm are stern, dedicated, and loyal, perhaps to a fault.  Helm teaches that the right path is not always obvious, but the surest way to the right path is through the execution of duty.  As such, watchers of helm strive to do what they must despite the consequences, to themselves or even to others.  While othes may suggest that this supposed 'dedication' is nothing more than a fetish, the watcher has no time for such nonsense. They do not have the idle time to question; it is their duty to be ever alert for possible threats to cosmic order.   

Advantages:
- Watchers automatically gain a proficiency point in bastard , Helm's favored weapon.  Fighter clerics do not get this bonus, but they are able to gain mastery with the bastard sword.
- Heightened Awareness: +1 bonus to AC and +2 bonus to save vs breath
- Can cast Helm's eye as a special ability once per day at 9th level.  The watcher gains an additional use at levels 11, 13, 15, 17 and 19. Helm's eye is equivalent to the wizard spell, wizard eye.
- Can cast Seeking Sword as a special ability once per day.  The Watcher gains an additional use at levels 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20.

SEEKING SWORD: This spell creates a sword in the Cleric's hand that cannot be dropped or unequipped. The sword is enchanted as a +4 weapon and provides a +4 THAC0 bonus, but no damage bonus. It deals 2d4 damage to any target it hits. The weapon sets the Cleric's number of attacks per round to 3 and lasts for 1 round per level. While it is equipped, the wielder cannot cast further spells.

Restrictions:
- Alignment: May be Lawful Good, Lawful Neutral, or True Neutral.

**Ur-Priest**
Ur-Priests are heretical practitioners that have found a way to wrest divine power from the gods with the use of ancient and forbidden rituals.  As might be expected, this behavior is frowned upon by the gods, and Ur-Priests have to keep their profession secret or risk persecution or worse.

Advantages:
- Sphere Access: Very high access.  The Ur-Priest gains major access to all spheres except the life, benediction, plant, animal and light spheres.
- Sap the Spirit: Ur-Priests can use the same techniques to drain living beings of their divine essence in much the same way they do so from the gods; though, of course, mortals do not have much of a divine essence, and so the benefits of this ability are limited.
This ability can be used once per day at fifth level.  The Ur-Priest can use Sap the Spirit an additional time per day at levels 10, 15 and 20.

SAP THE SPIRIT: This ability deals 1d4 magic damage to a living target per 4 levels of the Ur-Priest (2d4 at 5th level; maximum 6d4 at 20th level).
Beginning at 5th level, if the Ur-Priest kills a target with this ability, <PRO_HESHE> casts priest spells at +1 level for 5 rounds.  
At 10th level, if the Ur-Priest kills a target with this ability, <PRO_HESHE> also gains the benefits of the spell, Wondrous Recall.

Disadvantages:
- Cannot Turn Undead
- The rituals tax the Ur-Priest, making them more vulnerable to the effects of disease and magic.  They gain a -2 penalty to save vs. death and spells.

Deity access: None, despises the gods.

Restrictions: Cannot be of a good or lawful alignment
